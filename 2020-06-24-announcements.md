## How to contribute to Announcements

Anyone in the CFDE can contribute by adding comments to [the open
announcements issue in this repository](https://github.com/nih-cfde/announcements/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Announcements).
The infrastructure team will coordinate the process of assembling the final
email, and distributing it through the Announcements mailing list.
