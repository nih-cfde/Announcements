# CFDE Announcements

Hello CFDE!

This week we have ongoing Cross-Pollination events as well some recent presentations by CFDE members to share.

## Cross-Pollination Events

**CFDE Connections and Data Sharing**, the next meeting in our ongoing Cross-Pollination Series is Tuesday, November 17 at 11am (PST) / 2pm (EST). Everyone is welcome!  This will be the last of our weekly scheduled Cross-Pollination meetings as we transition to monthly meetings. We will be having events the first Tuesday of every month, at 11am (PST) / 2pm (EST). Please hold the time in your calendar, and stay tuned for more details.  Do take a moment to join our [Cross-Pollination Mailing List](https://crosspollinationevents.groups.io/g/main) where you will have access to calendar invites, updates, and reminders. 

On November 10 we held our CFDE Portal Demo and Roadmap event. Members of the technical team reviewed the CFDE portal, covering aspects such as querying the data catalog, reviewing summaries of CFDE data, and sharing tools we will use for data submission. We also surveyed members of the data ecosystem consortium for CFDE portal improvements, and gathered additional information about metadata types that will be needed by the DCCs. You can [view the recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VswjjZaq3Pv2_3fgJJz7NSlVRfoK6dAK/view?usp=sharing) or checkout the [transcript](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GFkvlBOEoCaZ7Tx7nPkVfQRGzCZu6pKu/view?usp=sharing) in our Google drive archive.

4. Enter this address into the 'Add calendar' field: eqvesqk6fdt41eei3sb02a2fpk@group.calendar.google.com
